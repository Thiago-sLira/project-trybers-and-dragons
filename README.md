<h1>Trybers and Dragons</h1>
<p>An RPG game to spend time with friends.</p>

<h2>🚀 Objective</h2>
<p>To apply SOLID architecture principles and object-oriented programming principles in a RPG role-playing game structure.</p><br>
<p>Learning OOP was not simple, writing the same code in a different paradigm led me to understand concepts that I had only seen before. It was challenging to understand inheritance and how it can be beneficial for the whole application without making a class dependent on another, leaving it abstract. It was very fun to work on this project.</p>
